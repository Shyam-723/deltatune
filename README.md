## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Spotify app installed and running
- Swift 5.9 or later (for building from source)

## How It Works

The app uses:
- **ScriptingBridge** to communicate with Spotify
- **SwiftUI** for the modern UI and settings interface
- **AppKit** for window management and system integration
- **Core Text** for custom font loading
- **UserDefaults** for persistent settings storage

## Troubleshooting

- **Overlay not showing**: Make sure Spotify is running and playing music
- **Custom font not working**: Ensure the font file is valid and accessible
- **Position not updating**: Try restarting the app after changing position settings
